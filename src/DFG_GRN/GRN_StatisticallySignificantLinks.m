% GRN_StatisticallySignificantLinks  Computate statistically signif. links
%
% Given a set of same-size matrices representing gene-tf interactions
% (links), compute the average matrix of links, and check each link value
% whether it is statistically significant at a specified <p_level>.
% The distribution of average link values is obtained in a non-parametric
% way by random permutations of observed link matrices.
%
% Syntax:
%   [pNet, pNetBinary, net] = ...
%     GRN_StatisticallySignificantLinks(nets, p_level)
% Inputs:
%   nets:    cell array of <K> matrices of size <N> x <M>
%   p_level: scalar between 0 and 0.5, typically 0.001
% Outputs:
%   pNet:       matrix of size <N> x <M> of P-values
%   pNetBinary: boolean matrix of size <N> x <M> (is there a link or not?)
%   net:        matrix of size <N> x <M> of average link values
