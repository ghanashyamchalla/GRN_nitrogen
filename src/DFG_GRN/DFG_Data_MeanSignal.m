% DFG_Data_MeanSignal  Compute mean energy and mean delta
%
% Syntax:
%   [dYmean, e_mean_signal] = ...
%     DFG_Data_MeanSignal(yTrain, yTest, yKnownTrain, yKnownTest)
% Inputs:
%   yTrain:      matrix of observed values, size <N> x <T1>, or cell array
%   yTest:       matrix of observed values, size <N> x <T2>, or cell array
%   yKnownTrain: matrix of indicators, size <N> x <T1>, or cell array
%   yKnownTest:  matrix of indictaors, size <N> x <T2>, or cell array
% Outputs:
%   dYmean:        vector of mean deltas, size <N> x <1>
%   e_mean_signal: mean square energy
%
% N.B. In the (probable case) that there are several sequences,
% the above matrices become cell arrays, each cell containing a matrix.
% The number of time points can change between sequences, but the number of
% genes <N> must remain the same.
