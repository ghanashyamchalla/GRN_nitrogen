% DFG_Energy_Gaussian  Energy of the Gaussian regressor
%
% Given a matrix <x> of size <N> x <T>, i.e. <T> samples of dimension <N>,
% and a matrix <xStar> of same size <N> x <T> that approximates <x>,
% compute a vector of Gaussian energies of size 1 x <T> following energy:
% 1/2 * sum _n (x_{n, t} - xStar_{n, t})^2
% If some elements x_{n,t} are unknown, they can be specified in <xKnown>
% as xKnown(n, t) = 0.
%
% Syntax:
%   e = DFG_Energy_Gaussian(x, x_star, xKnown)
% Inputs:
%   x:      matrix of target variables of size <N> x <T>
%   xStar:  matrix of generated variables of size <N> x <T>
%   xKnown: matrix of indicator variables (1=known) of size <N> x <T>
% Output:
%   e:      energy of the Gaussian regressor, vector of size 1 x <T>
